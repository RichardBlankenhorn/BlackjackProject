# BlackJack Project

- The overall goal of this project is to simulate a game of blackjack. When the user begins the program, they will be prompted to provide their name and their wallet size, or the amount that they would like to use to bet. Once this information has been provided, they will be able to elect to deal or quite the game. If deal is selected, the player will be given the two cards and also shown the house cards (one is blank) along with the value. The player may then choose to hit or stay. If the player chooses to hit, they will be dealt another card and then all cards will be displayed along with the hand value. From here, they may choose to hit again or stay and this process will continue until the player either busts or chooses to stay. After the player is finished and assuming they did not bust, it will be the house's turn. The house will continue to be dealt cards until their hand value is 17 or more. If they bust, a message will be displayed. If the house does not bust, the two hands will be compared and the winner determined.
